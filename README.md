# Andy in Codeland

Personal blog filled with quick insights, homecook research and eager discoveries to help anyone who luckily - or not *haha* - encounter the page. So, you visitor are more than welcomed to get to work and help me to build reliable data - but if you just stop by to use my posts to get out of some troublesome, I won't mind as well... ;)

As a good FLOSS enthusiast, I highly encouraged you to contribute with discussions, cutting-edge analysis whenever possible. Any contribution is more than greeted.

## How to contribute

All geeks and TI professionals - with emphasis to FLOSS community - suggest to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) as main driver here, for a variety of reasons. If is a worrisome source for you, [here are some tips to get going using Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).
For fast-fowarding-back-to-the-future abilities, you could get to assist this blog by reproducing the following steps below.

### Managing local repository
First, configure your Git credentials locally by typing:

```Git
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "username@email.com"
```
Then, clone this repo by copy pasting this line - *bare with me, I highly suggest you use SSH to save some valuable time. More info [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/09/keeping-your-account-safe/) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for Github guys.*
```Git
git clone git@gitlab.com:krenak/blog.git
```
Also, to mantain things organized, it's standard procedure to create a branch and work on that:

```Git
git branch new_branch
git checkout -b new_branch
```
Once your clonning and branching are done, head to your (*or ours heheheh*) new cloned directory by typing:
```
cd AndyInCodeland/
```
Now you're in the folder, you can modify any of the files and commit the changes later.

## Getting in touch
In case you are not confortable to do this *reverse-trailblazing* stuff directly, without previous communication, you can hit me up a [email](mailto:kaspa@onionmail.org) using this public key, for safety reasons - *hey, safety first always!* :D
